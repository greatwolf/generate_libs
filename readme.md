generate_libs
=============

Noel Llopis' [***generate_libs***](http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/wp-content/uploads/bin/generate_libs.zip) Python script for benchmarking build systems. This fork adds generation for many other build systems including some of the lesser known ones.

generate_libs needs Python 2.7 or later to be available on the system as a prereq. To display help, run generate_libs.py without any arguments.
